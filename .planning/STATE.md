# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-27)

**Core value:** A fuzzed input that produces a different `tokenId` in Haskell than in Plank must fail the build.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — RED Differential Scaffold

Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-08-27 — Roadmap created and revised; 32/32 v1 requirements mapped across 11 feature phases

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Affecting current work:

- Haskell spec is the oracle; the hand-ported Solidity `validate()` stays as an independent structural check, not the oracle.
- `VolOrder` becomes `VolOrder(T)` with an `extra: T` payload, following the in-repo `Shock(R)` pattern — no in-place signature break.
- The `VolOrder(T)` refactor is a blocking prerequisite; the diff test consumes the generic type.
- Plank is the fuzz source; inputs are transported to Haskell, never constructed independently on each side.
- Enforce the diff test inside `develop-gate` — a self-skipping test is silently unenforced.
- `.planning/phases/FEATURES/feat-*/` adopted as the milestone layout; GSD tooling for it deferred to v2.
- Phase 5 is a dedicated interactive RPC/transport design phase: it owns the transport decision and fixes the responsibility split between the Haskell spec service and the Foundry test process, proven by a payload-free protocol skeleton.
- Phase 6 (spec oracle) is built test-first (TDD) from its architecture and specification.
- No local compilation: dependencies/submodules are deliberately left uninitialized locally; CI manages them and the compiler's answer is read from `develop-gate`, for pushes and PRs alike.

**Open by design — owned by phase planning, do not pre-resolve:**

- `VolOrder(T)` wire format: Shock-style tagged vs per-variant layout → **Phase 4**
- Spec transport: `vm.ffi` binary vs Haskell JSON-RPC service (`vm.rpc`) → **Phase 5** (owns it; an interactive design phase, not a pick-and-go)
- Oracle packaging: new cabal exe vs a mode on `cfmm-scratchpad-exe` → **Phase 6**

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **GHC/cabal on the self-hosted runner is unverified.** Phase 11 (CI-02) may require provisioning the toolchain, not just invoking it. Surface early during Phase 5/6 planning.
- **CI ordering tension (accepted).** CI-01/CI-02 put the spec on the runner but sit in Phase 11, while Phases 6–10 need spec reachability to be gate-observable. The RED-05 wiring probe absorbs this; if it proves insufficient, pull CI-01/CI-02 forward via `/gsd:insert-phase` rather than reordering silently.
- **Two-repo cost in Phase 6.** Spec changes land via `JMSBPP` fork → PR into `d2p-finance/cfmm-vol-markets-spec` plus a submodule pin bump here.

## Reminders

- Every phase = one git worktree named after its `feat/…` branch + a tracking issue on `develop`.
- CI (`develop-gate`) is the sole validation gate. Never report work as verified from a local build or local `forge test`.
- Regression floor: `test/protocol_integrations/VolOrderToPanopticTokenId.t.sol` stays green in every gate run.
- Every plan passes the two-step review (Reality Checker + one matched specialist, in parallel) before execution.
