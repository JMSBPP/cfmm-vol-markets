# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-27)

**Core value:** A parameter set flows end-to-end — (stub) GAMS output → encoded to Plank fixed-point → written via `initVolTermStructure` → read back and round-trip-verified — with both tracks bound to one authoritative kernel.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Repository Restructure & Sanitize

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Repository Restructure & Sanitize)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-27 — Roadmap regenerated to plumbing-first scope (7 phases, 30/30 requirements mapped)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Plumbing-first scope: prove the connection layer carries parameters correctly with a stub GAMS solver; real optimization model + replication proof + LDF conformance are v2.
- Phase order fixed: Plank bridge-surface is implemented AND compiled (Phase 4) BEFORE the bridge wiring (Phase 6) — resolves the prior phase-order inversion BLOCKER.
- Phases 1 and 2 are serialized (no parallelism) to avoid the repo-identity race during the public flip / fork migration.
- Theory grounding links to cfmm-theory `KERNEL.md` by URL/citekey (no submodule); refs under `spec/refs/`.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[From codebase concerns audit — affect future phases]

- **Repo ownership inverted + destructive migration** (Phase 1): `JMSBPP` is standalone origin; `wvs-finance` repo does not yet exist. The public flip and the destructive fork-migration step (REPO-02) are outward-facing and MUST be confirmed with the user at execution (Concern 11, PROJECT constraints).
- **Publish-readiness leaks** (Phase 1): tracked `refs/` Next.js app + `node_modules`, `Counter` scaffold, broken CI, and absolute `/home/jmsbpp/...` paths must be scrubbed before the public flip (REPO-05; Concerns 7, 9, 10).
- **Plank toolchain unpinned + silent-zero FFI** (Phase 2): `plank v0.1.1` via curl-bash with no lockfile; deployer/`plankified-univ3` on floating HEAD. Pin and add loud FFI guards before relying on builds (TOOL-01/02; Concern 3).
- **Plank sources are stubs/parse-errors** (Phase 4): `VolatilityTermStructure.plk`, `IMarketDynamicsLens.plk`, `Numerics.plk` have empty selectors/untyped fields/`u265` typo. Phase 4 must implement AND compile the bridge surface (PLNK-04; Concern 2).
- **Bridge is a zero-line gap** (Phase 6): GAMS↔Plank integration does not exist; the exchange format + per-hop encoding (Phase 3) gate the wiring (Concern 4).
- **GAMS solver is a deliberate stub** (Phase 5): GAMS-02 emits the artifact with a stub objective only; the real model is v2 (`PAY-01`).
