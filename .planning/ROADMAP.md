# Roadmap: CFMM Payoff Replication — Plank ↔ GAMS Connection Layer (v1 Plumbing)

## Overview

This milestone builds the **open-loop plumbing** that carries a parameter set from a (stub) GAMS solver, through a defined encoding contract, into a compiled Plank write/read surface, and back out via a round-trip equality check — all bound to one authoritative kernel. The journey is deliberately ordered plumbing-first: first make the repository public-ready and canonical (Phase 1), then co-locate the GAMS sources and pin the toolchain and kernel both tracks conform to (Phase 2), then write the encoding contract and theory grounding the implementation and bridge both consume (Phase 3), then implement **and compile** the Plank bridge-surface BEFORE wiring it (Phase 4), then stand up the GAMS stub emitter (Phase 5), then wire the runtime bridge with read-back round-trip and selector conformance (Phase 6), and finally run the whole thing end-to-end behind hard guards (Phase 7).

This milestone proves the connection layer *carries parameters correctly* — it does **not** prove payoff replication, run a real optimization model, or assert LDF conformance; those are explicitly v2. This is an early research repo: most `.plk` sources are stubs or have parse/type errors, the Plank↔GAMS bridge is a zero-line gap, and the GAMS solver is intentionally a stub this milestone. The phases below assume nothing about working replication, a real optimization model, or LDF correctness.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Repository Restructure & Sanitize** - Canonical public `wvs-finance` repo, `JMSBPP` fork, and a publish-readiness scrub gating the public flip
- [ ] **Phase 2: Vendoring, Shared Kernel & Toolchain Pin** - GAMS vendored into `model/`, the bridge-path kernel fully specified, the Plank toolchain + submodules pinned with loud FFI guards
- [ ] **Phase 3: Encoding Contract & Theory Grounding** - The per-hop fixed-point encode/decode + ABI/storage-slot contract, plus the parameter→theory reference notes
- [ ] **Phase 4: Plank Bridge-Surface Implementation & Compile** - Implemented and cleanly-compiling Plank write body, struct read, and lens getters for every seeded field
- [ ] **Phase 5: GAMS Plumbing (stub solver)** - GAMS model runs from `model/` and emits the bridge-consumed parameter artifact with a stub objective
- [ ] **Phase 6: Open-Loop Runtime Bridge** - Serialize → encode → write → read-back round-trip equality, plus selector conformance
- [ ] **Phase 7: End-to-End Plumbing Run** - One command runs the full open-loop plumbing path, succeeding only if the FFI guards and round-trip pass

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Repository Restructure & Sanitize
**Goal**: The project lives in the correct ownership topology — a canonical public `wvs-finance` upstream with a `JMSBPP` fork — and the tree is sanitized so nothing leaks or breaks when it goes public.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase). Outward-facing — the public flip and the destructive fork-migration step are confirmed with the user at execution.
**Requirements**: REPO-01, REPO-02, REPO-03, REPO-04, REPO-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `git grep -InE '/home/[a-z0-9_-]+/'` returns nothing; `refs/`, `node_modules`, and the `Counter` scaffold are absent from tracked files; and `.gitignore` covers `node_modules`/build artifacts (REPO-05).
  2. The public flip and the destructive fork-migration step (retire/rename the existing standalone `JMSBPP` repo) execute only after an explicit user confirmation, following a documented, reversible backup → create-canonical → retire → fork sequence with the destructive step called out (REPO-02, REPO-05).
  3. `git remote -v` shows `upstream` → `wvs-finance/cfmm-replicationPlank` and `origin` → the `JMSBPP` fork, and `wvs-finance/...` is reachable as a public repo that is the canonical upstream (REPO-01, REPO-03).
  4. `README.md` is no longer Foundry boilerplate and describes the Plank/GAMS dual-track plus setup (REPO-04).
  5. The broken CI is fixed or explicitly disabled so a fresh clone does not present a misleading red check at the public flip (REPO-05).
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01-PLAN.md — Local sanitize (remove refs/, Counter, broken CI; scrub home paths; README + MIT LICENSE) and squash to one clean baseline (REPO-04, REPO-05)
- [ ] 01-02-PLAN.md — Gated irreversible migration: push baseline, transfer to wvs-finance, flip public, fork back to JMSBPP, set remotes (REPO-01, REPO-02, REPO-03)

### Phase 2: Vendoring, Shared Kernel & Toolchain Pin
**Goal**: Both tracks are co-located and reproducible — GAMS sources live inside the repo, the bridge-path type kernel is fully and unambiguously specified, and the Plank toolchain plus submodules are pinned with FFI guards that fail loudly.
**Depends on**: Phase 1 (serialized — no Phase 1∥Phase 2 parallelism, to avoid the repo-identity race the review flagged).
**Requirements**: GAMS-01, KERN-01, KERN-02, KERN-03, TOOL-01, TOOL-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. ✓ **DONE (pre-completed)** — GAMS sources are tracked under `model/` and the pipeline references that path; residual `../experiments/gams` text references cleaned in the Phase 1 scrub (GAMS-01). Phase 2 carries only KERN-01..03 + TOOL-01..02 as remaining work.
  2. The FFI build asserts `plank --version` matches a pinned `.plank-version` (with the `sona` codegen backend declared) and fails loudly on mismatch; the deployer/`plankified-univ3` submodules are pinned to specific commits; and the deploy path asserts returned bytecode length > 0 and deployed address ≠ 0 (TOOL-01, TOOL-02).
  3. Every type on the enumerated bridge path — `VolatilityTermStructure` and its fields, plus the `NumberFormat`/`BoundedValue` they use — carries number format, bounds, and unit semantics with no placeholder bounds (the `baseTick` bound resolved to a concrete int24 range) (KERN-01).
  4. A concrete conformance mechanism (a generated shared constants file both sides include, or a checked field-by-field cross-reference) binds the Plank type and the GAMS symbols to one kernel definition — not prose alone (KERN-02).
  5. The kernel states the canonical fixed-point conventions (WAD `1e18`, Q64.96) using one canonical name for the Q64.96 format consistently (`Q64x96`/`Q64.96`/`Q96_ONE` reconciled) (KERN-03).
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: TBD

### Phase 3: Encoding Contract & Theory Grounding
**Goal**: The single source of truth for how every parameter crosses the boundary exists — a per-hop fixed-point encode/decode chain plus the ABI/storage-layout contract — and each mapped parameter is grounded to its theory note. This spec is consumed by both the Plank implementation (Phase 4) and the bridge (Phase 6).
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (kernel + fixed-point conventions).
**Requirements**: MAP-01, MAP-02, MAP-03, MAP-04, MAP-05, MAP-06, REF-01, REF-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A GAMS↔Plank mapping table covers at least `xi`↔`priceElasticity`/LDF `alpha`, `iota`↔`statePartitionDelta`/`tickSpacing`, and `baseTick`, each with an explicit mapping direction (MAP-01).
  2. Each parameter has a documented per-hop encode/decode chain with scale base and rounding mode for every quantizing hop, and the `priceElasticity` upper bound is corrected so the type covers the full valid `alpha` range (resolving `Q96_ONE` < `MAX_ALPHA`) (MAP-02).
  3. Signed `baseTick` encoding is specified (int24 two's-complement sign-extended to `u256`, rounded to a `tickSpacing` multiple, within resolved int24 bounds) and a `tickSpacing` divisibility invariant for `tickLower`/`tickUpper` is enforced (MAP-03, MAP-04).
  4. The `initVolTermStructure` ABI + storage-layout contract is specified (signature string, ABI arg layout, on-storage bit-packing) with selector `0xd9c112ef` verified to equal `keccak(signature)[:4]`, and the write slot and simulator read slots are reconciled into declared slots with no undefined `SLOT_TICK_*` (MAP-05, MAP-06).
  5. Each mapped parameter has a reference markdown under `spec/refs/` citing its `cfmm-theory` grounding note (primary `KERNEL.md`) by URL/citekey with no code dependency on the theory tree, annotated with the behavioral theorem/assumption/regime it encodes (REF-01, REF-02).
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01: TBD

### Phase 4: Plank Bridge-Surface Implementation & Compile
**Goal**: The actual Plank write body, struct read, and lens getters are implemented per the Phase 3 contract AND compile cleanly via the pinned FFI build — delivered BEFORE the bridge wiring so the wiring has a real surface to call. This fixes the prior phase-order inversion BLOCKER.
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (the layout/encoding/slot contract).
**Requirements**: PLNK-01, PLNK-02, PLNK-03, PLNK-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `src/types/VolatilityTermStructure.plk` has a working `read` that decodes the stored struct per the MAP-05 layout (PLNK-01).
  2. `IMarketDynamics.initVolTermStructure` has an implemented body that decodes calldata and stores into the reconciled MAP-05/MAP-06 slot — not just a selector constant (PLNK-02).
  3. `IMarketDynamicsLens` getters `getPriceElasticity`, `getStatePartitionDelta`, and `getBaseTick` are implemented, providing a read-back view for every seeded field (PLNK-03).
  4. All Plank sources on the bridge/pipeline path compile cleanly via the pinned FFI build — the parse/type stubs (`SELECTOR_… =;`, untyped fields, `uint256` vs `u256`, the `u265` typo) blocking the path are fixed (PLNK-04).
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 04-01: TBD

### Phase 5: GAMS Plumbing (stub solver)
**Goal**: The GAMS side produces the artifact the bridge consumes, running from the vendored location with a stub objective — enough to feed the pipe, no real optimization.
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (vendored sources), Phase 3 (knows the output shape/encoding to emit).
**Requirements**: GAMS-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The GAMS model runs from `model/` and exits successfully using a stub/placeholder objective (a trivial or fixed map is acceptable this milestone) (GAMS-02).
  2. The run emits the parameter-output artifact in the shape/encoding the Phase 3 contract defines for the bridge to consume (GAMS-02).
  3. The stub objective is clearly marked as such; no real optimization model is present, and the real model remains a v2 (`PAY-01`) deferral (GAMS-02).
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 05-01: TBD

### Phase 6: Open-Loop Runtime Bridge
**Goal**: The connection layer is wired — GAMS output is serialized, encoded per contract, written to the compiled Plank surface, and read back with a round-trip equality and selector-conformance check. This is the open-loop bridge: no in-loop parameter updates.
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (encoding contract), Phase 4 (compiled Plank write/read surface), Phase 5 (GAMS output to serialize).
**Requirements**: BRDG-01, BRDG-02, BRDG-03, BRDG-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. GAMS output is serialized to a defined exchange format (e.g., JSON or ABI-encoded calldata) that the Plank side consumes (BRDG-01).
  2. A bridge step encodes the parameters per the MAP-02 contract and writes them via `IMarketDynamics.initVolTermStructure()` (selector `0xd9c112ef`) (BRDG-02).
  3. The seeded parameters are read back through the lens views and a round-trip equality holds — `decode(readback) ≈ original` within the stated quantization tolerance — for every seeded field (BRDG-03).
  4. A selector-conformance test asserts each Plank selector constant on the path equals `keccak(documented signature)[:4]` (BRDG-04).
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 06-01: TBD

### Phase 7: End-to-End Plumbing Run
**Goal**: A single command runs the full open-loop plumbing path end-to-end and is honest about success — it passes only if the guards and round-trip pass, and the simulate step does no closed-loop updates.
**Depends on**: Phase 6.
**Requirements**: PIPE-01, PIPE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. One command runs payoff spec → (stub) GAMS solve → encode → Plank write → read-back, end-to-end (PIPE-01).
  2. That command exits success only if the TOOL-02 FFI guards (bytecode length > 0, address ≠ 0) and the BRDG-03 round-trip pass, and exits non-zero (fails loudly) otherwise (PIPE-01).
  3. An open-loop guard asserts the swap-replay/simulate step performs no in-loop parameter updates, keeping the closed-loop controller out of this milestone (PIPE-02).
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 07-01: TBD

## Scope Boundary

This is **open-loop plumbing only**. Explicitly out of this milestone (v2):
- Correct payoff **replication** proof, replication-error metric + tolerance (`PROOF-*`)
- Real GAMS optimization model — Phase 5 is a **stub objective** (`PAY-01`)
- LDF conformance / `SwapAmtGen` overflow fix (`LDF-*`)
- Closed-loop adaptive controller + V4 `beforeSwap` hook (`CTRL-*`) — Phase 7's PIPE-02 guard actively keeps in-loop updates out
- Production / mainnet deployment, multiple-payoff library (`PLIB-01`), formal literature review (`RIG-01`), secure on-chain randomness (`RIG-02`)

## Deferred Review Findings (do NOT block roadmap; resolve during phase planning)

The two-step review confirmed all original BLOCKERs/MAJORs resolved. The following finer findings were surfaced on the revised roadmap and are **deferred to phase planning** (by user direction — not blocking initialization):

- **Selector `0xd9c112ef` is likely wrong** (Phase 3 / MAP-05, Phase 6 / BRDG-02): no plausible `initVolTermStructure` signature reproduces it. At Phase 3, treat the kernel-derived **signature string as authoritative**, recompute the selector, and correct the constant; reference all path selectors symbolically. Extend the signature pinning to the lens getters (BRDG-04).
- **Single quantization boundary** (Phase 3 / MAP-02, Phase 5 / GAMS-02, Phase 6 / BRDG-01): decide one place that does fixed-point encoding — recommended: **GAMS emits raw decimals, the bridge owns all encoding** — and define the off-chain exchange format in Phase 3 so Phase 5 emits against it.
- **Round-trip should be exact** (Phase 6 / BRDG-03): with the replication metric descoped to v2, require **exact equality on the stored integer** for `{priceElasticity, statePartitionDelta, baseTick}` via the lens (hop-1 only); drop the `≈`/tolerance language and the `/LDF` read-back (LDF is a v2 stub).
- **REPO-05 verification** (Phase 1): scan tracked file **contents** (`git grep -InE '/home/[a-z0-9_-]+/'`), not filenames; relativize/URL-ify the local home-absolute paths in `.planning/` docs; vendor GAMS (GAMS-01) before the public flip so no `../experiments/gams` path remains.
- **PIPE-02** (Phase 7): the v1 e2e path has no simulate-update step — phrase the open-loop guard as a **structural** assertion (no controller/update code on the path), not a runtime guard on a non-existent step.
- **Minor:** pin the concrete scale base for `alpha`/`priceElasticity` (MAP-02); add Phase 4 `Depends on: Phase 2`; define the PIPE-01 "payoff spec" as a fixed v1 input fixture; for KERN-02 prefer the checked field-by-field cross-reference (GAMS `$include` and Plank `import` can't share one file).

### Phase 8: panoptic vol-claim lean4 formalization

**Goal:** Formalize `spec/panoptic.md` in the `lean/` Lake project: the contract as a volatility option (payoff π^σ = ΔQ_v·(σ²(i(t)) − σ²_K)⁺), the vol-claim price as an option-replication cost (Demeterfi et al. variance-swap decomposition + Panoptic streaming-premium θ kernel), and identification of the vega-like greek υ ≡ Δπ/Δσ² in its analytical/contract-level form (econometric identification via the Panoptic subgraph is scoped during discussion). Owned by the Lean4+math session (worktree `lean4-spec`, branch `feat/lean4-spec`).
**Requirements**: no formal REQ-IDs — the locked decisions in `08-CONTEXT.md` are the requirements (CTX-HYGIENE, CTX-VENDOR, CTX-PAYOFF, CTX-REPLIC, CTX-PREMIUM, CTX-CRR-THETA, CTX-UPSILON, CTX-CONJ, CTX-ECONO, CTX-THETA-PROOF)
**Depends on:** Phase 1 only (Lean4 track — builds on the conglomerated `lean/` Lake project, independent of Phases 2–7 owned by other sessions)
**Plans:** 3/5 plans executed
